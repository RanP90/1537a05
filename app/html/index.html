            Panda is a shy boy who will hide at first until he feels safe to
            come out. Once you have gained his trust he will head butt you when
            you come home from work to tell you he loves you and missed you. He
            loves to look out the window from his cat tree, and likes to seek
            out high places (like closets) to hide.

            Dennis and Missy are a bonded pair who are both cuddle bugs that
            love lots of pets and attention. Missy will come to you as soon as
            you see her. Dennis is a little more shy and will wait for you to
            initiate the pets, but once you do he doesn’t want you to stop!

            Boots was a spicy feral kitty when he first arrived at the rescue.
            Over time with lots of love from his foster mom, and with his fellow
            foster brothers and sisters showing him how to cat, he has become an
            extremely affectionate boy. In fact, when the house is quiet, you
            will find it hard to ignore his attention. He truly loves to be with
            other cats and would need to go to a home with another kitty pal. He
            loves scratches around his head and belly, and is currently figuring
            out how to be a lap cat. He watches intently and you can see he
            wants to do it too. Boots is a handsome tomcat who’s a talker, but
            his voice is very soft. He is such a lover with so much love to
            give.

            is a love bug who loves to cuddle up with you. He loves chin

            close to you enjoying as many pets as he can get.
